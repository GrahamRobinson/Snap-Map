# Snap-Map
Snap-Map was a second year project that was created within a group of 3 people, it is an API mashup of Instagram, Google Maps, and Twitter.

The aim of this project was to allow the user to enter a location in the top bar and for the page to automatically reload to display the most current instagram photos uploaded from that location.

The user could also select a location from the google maps API at the bottom of the screen which would function just like the field at the top of the page

Finally the user would also be able to click the "Tweet" button at the top of the page which would automatically create a tweet for them to submit.
