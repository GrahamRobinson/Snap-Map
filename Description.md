# Snap-Map
API mashup of Instagram, Google Maps, and Twitter

The aim of this project was to allow the user to enter a location in the top bar and for the page to automatically reload to display the most current instagram photos uploaded from that location.

The user could also select a location from the google maps API at the bottom of the screen which would function just like the field at the top of the page
